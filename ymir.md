She obtained her powers by falling into a body of water way underground. a worm looking parasite attached to her spine, giving her the ppwers of the titans. How did she end up there? well she was running from guards to kill her but also allowed her to run to make it a chasing game for the guards. She saw a huge hollow tree and tried to hide in it, little did she know, there was a hole leading all the way down to the body of water.
