King Fritz was a monarch who ruled the Marleyan Empire during the Great Titan War (about 100 years before the main storyline). he created the walls in Paradis Island, named after his daughters with Ymir Fritz (maria, sheena, and rose). It is unclear what happened to him in the end, although many speculate that he committed suicide after losing power over hispeople. Other people think that he went into hiding with his family somewhere is Paradis Island. Regardless, after his departure, many remembered him as a coardly and selfish person who doomed his own people by erasing their memories.
