How are king fritz and Ymir Fritz related? Despite king fritz at first being frightened by Ymir's titan, he eventually thought of it as a tool for war and decided to take her as his concubine and later had the 3 girls ![Alt text](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fso-if-ymir-loved-king-fritz-why-did-she-take-that-spear-and-v0-v0ryq8401fwa1.jpg%3Fwidth%3D743%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dd4f7ea98126a6907695e4cb1882044f04692f09d). As previously mentioned, King Fritz created the 3 walls seen in the main storyline, however that isnt technically right, he actually had Ymir use her powers to create the walls as he saw it was necessary to keep the Eldian population safe ![Alt text](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/shingekinokyojin/images/d/df/Ymir_sculps_the_Wall_Titans.png/revision/latest?cb=20191010034210). One day there was an assassination attempt on King Fritz, which wouldve been successful if it wasnt for Ymir who used her own body to shield him, a large spear pierced her chest ![Alt text](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/shingekinokyojin/images/f/f8/Ymir_saves_Fritz.png/revision/latest?cb=20191009034348). Although Ymir couldve just regenerated using the power of the titan, she decided not to after seeing King Fritz show no concern towards her, she decided she would no longer serve the king after years of abuse. However this wasnt the end for the power of the titans, just after her death, King Fritz forced her 3 daughters to eat her corpse in hopes that the power would be passed down ![Alt text](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/shingekinokyojin/images/b/b6/Maria%2C_Rose%2C_and_Sheena_cannibalize_Ymir.png/revision/latest?cb=20191009011010). And it did, all 3 girls got the power and later reproduced to expand the bloodline. The rest is history.
